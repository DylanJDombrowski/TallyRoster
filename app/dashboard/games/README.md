```typescript
interface GameManagerProps {
  teams: Team[];
  initialGames: Game[];
  organizationId: string;
}
```

### Data Model

Games are structured with comprehensive tracking:

#### `games`
```typescript
interface Game {
  id: string;
  organization_id: string;
  home_team_id: string;
  away_team_id: string;
  game_date: string;
  game_time: string;
  venue?: string;
  home_score?: number;
  away_score?: number;
  status: 'scheduled' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  season?: string;
  notes?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  // Relationships
  home_team: Team;
  away_team: Team;
}
```

## Security & Access Control

### Administrator Access
Currently restricted to admin users:
```typescript
if (!userOrgRole || userOrgRole.role !== "admin") {
  return <p>Admin access required</p>;
}
```

### Organization Scoping
All games are scoped to the user's organization:
```typescript
const { data: games } = await supabase
  .from("games")
  .select("*")
  .eq("organization_id", userOrgRole.organization_id);
```
